# man-avg-cov
Minimal reproducible repository for average coverage manuscript.

# Options

There are a few options that should be consider before building as running the simulations from scratch is quite time consuming.

1. The number of iterations in the manuscript is 1000 for each simulation, but setting this to 100 will greatly reduce coputational costs. 
2. Running the debiased lasso on the Scheetz2006 dataset takes hours. Additionally, the version of `hdi` used can be found here:
